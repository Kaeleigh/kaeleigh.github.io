In today's job market, networking is one of the most effective ways of obtaining a job or rising through the ranks of one’s career. Entering a new career field can be daunting and confusing if one has no plan. This past Saturday, I attended the Tech Ladies: Design Thinking Your Career workshop. The overall goal of the workshop was to brainstorm and design a plan to overcome your career challenge.

[Tech Ladies](https://www.hiretechladies.com/), is a worldwide organization for women in the technology industry. Founded in 2016 by Allison Esposito, who previously worked for tech giants such as Google and Foursquare. Tech Ladies strives to connect female tech professionals with opportunities in the tech industry through their job board. Furthermore, the organization offers social networking events, career workshops and monthly blog posts highlighting innovative female tech professionals.

At Saturday’s workshop, to create a career plan we utilized the concept of design thinking. Although often used by designers to strategize their design process, this concept has been applied in business and towards social issues. In general, design thinking is a creative problem solving method used to resolve one’s issues. There are three stages involved: discovery, ideation and prototyping. Discovery phase focuses on defining the problem one is facing. Ideation phase includes brainstorming how to resolve the problem. Prototyping phase consists of developing a strategy of how to implement the solution.

Each participant was paired with a partner and a workbook to utilize while completing the design thinking process. My partner a software developer and Washingtonian (the state) native, was very informative and fun to work with. In the first phase-discovery- we both interviewed each other about our personal lives and professional ambitions. During this session, I had discovered that my career challenge was comprehending web development fundamentals and new concepts. As a result, I felt overwhelmed and unprepared at the prospect of applying for web developer jobs.

To prepare for the ideation phase, we were instructed to draw basic illustrations such as a book, dog and house. Drawing brought out people’s inner kid and allowed us to think outside of the box. During this phase, my partner came up with various solutions to my problem along with a drawing. A few of her solutions included finding more mentors outside of Bloc, attending a hackathon and tech meetups. Although my mentor within Bloc has been helpful, my partner believed finding a mentor outside the program could provide a different perspective and strategy to learning certain concepts. By visiting a hackathon, I would gain hands-on-experience as well as build my confidence in solving certain coding problems.

During the last phase, my partner utilized her drawing capabilities to suggest a detailed plan of how to resolve my challenge. The picture below showcases my partner’s actual proposal.

Based on her advice, I developed some action steps I would take within the next few weeks. The first action I have taken is signing up for Tech Lady Hackathon & Training Day in October. Next, I will attend more local meetups for developers and join local organizations that foster mentorships. Lastly, I will focus on tech positions within nonprofit organizations during my job search. Overall the workshop was enlightening, lively and a great opportunity to meet fellow techies.
