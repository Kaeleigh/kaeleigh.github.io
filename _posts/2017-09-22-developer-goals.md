title: FrontEnd Developer Goals
---

As a Frontend Developer, I would like to:

1. Build an appealing portfolio highlighting my abilities
    * It has been said a picture is worth a thousand words, thus what better way to demonstrate my web developer skills than with a stunning online portfolio. For each project, I will write a case study explaining the process of building the web application, along with snippets of code and pictures.
2. Strengthen my proficiency in writing JavaScript code  
  * So far within the BLOC curriculum, mastering JavaScript has been my greatest challenge. Since the JS is one of the key languages used to build websites and web applications it is essential that excel in writing JS. To achieve this, I will complete additional JS assignments using [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com), [Exorcism](https://www.exorcism.io) as well as watch educational videos from [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com).
3. Independently build an efficient, interactive and fun web application  
  * To truly test my web development abilities, I will build a separate website or web application without a step-by-step guide. Furthermore, contributing to any open source projects would provide hands on experience as well as serve as a great addition to my portfolio and resume.
4. Share my experience with others(especially women) who are interested in web development
  * According to the, [National Center for Women & Information Technology](https://www.ncwit.org/), there are thousands of jobs within the technology industry; yet women only hold 26% of those jobs. To expand women’s role in the industry, women from all ages must be educated on what a career in technology looks like and how to obtain that career. By sharing my own personal experience as well as mentoring other women, I can assist others in their quest to join the technology industry.
5. Develop a captivating resume that will grab the attention of hiring managers
  * Although my portfolio will demonstrate my web development skills, I need a resume to illustrate my soft skills such as communication, time management, adaptability and critical thinking. In order to succeed in any work environment, one must possess a combination of soft and hard skills. Furthermore, I would utilize my resume to present my educational background.
6. Expand knowledge of fundamental programming languages (**Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP**) as well as developer tools
  * As I continue my journey to become a web developer I will have to learn more advanced programming languages such as Java and C++. Knowing a variety of languages as well as how to utilize developer tools would increase my chances of obtaining a decent position at a great company.
7. Attend career and technology events in order to network with local developers
  * In addition, to my resume and portfolio I believe meeting local developers and engineers will further my chances of obtaining my dream job. Also by attending these events I can build a network of fellow developers that I can reach out to whenever I need help solving an issue or want to collaborate with on a project.
8. Learn and practice the best methods of passing a technical “whiteboard” interview
  * To ensure I succeed in passing the interview I will practice mock interviews with my mentor as well as complete the exercises within **_Gayle Laakmann McDowell’s novel: Cracking the Coding Interview_**. An extensive guide on how to successfully ace a technical interview.
9. Keep track of the latest trends and technologies within the web development sector
  * The technology industry is constantly evolving with new software, devices and designs. I rely on [Digital Trends](https://www.digitaltrends.com) and [TechCrunch](https://www.techcrunch.com) to stay informed so that my methods and skills will not become obsolete.
10. Obtain a junior web developer position at a midsize company
  * As appealing as Google and Amazon are (God knows I love their products/services) I would prefer to work at a midsize or smaller company in the nonprofit sector. Working at a nonprofit organization whose goals align with my personal values is an important factor in choosing which company I work for.
